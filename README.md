# Analyzing Customer Segments
Customer Segments Study performed within a Udacity Nanodegree program. A dataset with key properties of residents living in Germany is compared with a customer dataset with the same feature to pinpoint key differences. The motivation is to find relative differences to optimizing the targeting of the customer base.

Unfortunately, the dataset is proprietary and couldn't be included, but the plain code project teaches nicely how powerful basic machine learning approaches can be and how fast one can extract essential information.
